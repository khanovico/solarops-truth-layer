# AGENTS.md

## Repo

- Stack: set at project init.
- PRD: `.agents/docs/PRD.md` (create/update as you go)
- Structure: `.agents/docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (create/update as you go)

## Tests (cloud)

Failing tests only due to OS/deps you can’t fix → may bypass if change is clearly correct in prod. **Document bypass** in final report + PR.
For frontend change, `cd app && npm run build` should work.

## Always

- **Memory first:** `.agents/memory` — check before big decisions; add reusable lessons there.
- **Performance first-class:** for any frontend or API-touching change, review scale cost across request count, payload size, refetch frequency, client/render work, and loading UX. Prefer bounded/paginated flows, summary payloads, and stable layout shells during lazy loading.
- **No waiting on humans** (unless serious harm): workflows step-by-step; “confirm” = step done. Blocked unfixably → **stop + detailed report**. Unblocked → **end-to-end**. Ship as verified as practical.
- **Rule, conventions**: take a look at `.code/AGENTS.md` as rules lookup.

## Subagents
### For Codex
- Debug: `.codex/agents/debug-specialist.toml`
- Review: `.codex/agents/code-reviewer.toml`
- Scalability: `.codex/agents/scalability-reviewer.toml`

### For Cursor
- Debug: `.cursor/agents/debug-specialist.md`
- Review: `.cursor/agents/code-reviewer.md`  
Spawn when useful or instructed.

## Task intake

- Branch / PR target from task.
- Assets via URL → save under `.tmp/` (untracked).
- Execution mode → 
Main: `.agents/workflows/main-execution.md`
- General Execution Rule: Plan first, Plan -> SubPlan -> Todos -> Step by Step

## Memory

Reusable experience → write under `.agents/memory/` with sensible category.

## Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Test-Driven Development

Make sure your task - new feature, bug fix, update func, any of them - all covered by enough test.
If it is required, you can also leverage e2e testing strategy.
North Star -> Once it goes into Prod, it works, without affecting others.

Testing is not only for testing new func/feature, but this is also for future change won't affect this feature/implementation (future guardrail)
So always make sure enough test coverage for the feature you are currently implementing/updating.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Frontend rules
- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).
- No hero overlays: Do not place detached labels, floating badges, promo stickers, info chips, or callout boxes on top of hero media.
- One job per section: Each section should have one purpose, one headline, and usually one short supporting sentence.
- Real visual anchor: Imagery should show the product, place, atmosphere, or context. Decorative gradients and abstract backgrounds do not count as the main visual idea.
- Reduce clutter: Avoid pill clusters, stat strips, icon rows, boxed promos, schedule snippets, and multiple competing text blocks.
- Use motion to create presence and hierarchy, not noise. Ship at least 2-3 intentional motions for visually led work.
- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.
- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile.
- For React code, prefer modern patterns including useEffectEvent, startTransition, and useDeferredValue when appropriate if used by the team. Do not add useMemo/useCallback by default unless already used; follow the repo's React Compiler guidance.

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
