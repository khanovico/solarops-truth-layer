# Playwright integration

- UI ↔ API: `page.route` for stable mocks. Assert method/path/body when actions trigger requests.
- Loading → success/error in one flow. Few focused tests per area. Behavior/a11y, not pixels.

```ts
await page.route("**/api/leads*", (r) => r.fulfill({ status: 200, body: "[]" }));
await expect(page.getByText("No leads")).toBeVisible();
```
